						Burglar is a VR robbery simulation game with horror elements. As an aspiring thief, you break into homes to
						liberate as many valuables as possible without getting caught, and try to escape with your freedom… and life!

							<li>Different components that can be put on actors to get different kinds of interactions</li>
							<li>Grabbed objects are dropped if the hand gets too far away from the object</li>
							<li>Grabbing can be done freely on some items but others snap into specific positions</li>
							<li>
								Grabbing is done by checking if there is anything of the grabbable type near the hand that is free to pick
								up and then it is attached to the hand
							</li>
							<li>Stealing is done by just checking if the object is moved over the moneybag</li>
							<li>Using objects is just by clicking a button while an object that supports interactions is held</li>
