						This was a group game project in school where programmers, artists and designers worked together to create
						a game.
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
						You play as a newly transformed werewolf who has killed his own family in a moment of bloodlust.
						Devastated by the loss of your family, you try to leave the valley you live in, and escape into the
						mountains where you can never harm anyone again. Alas, the people living nearby have no intentions of
						letting you escape. Knowing only that a werewolf has killed some of their number, they are out in force to
						find you and end your life, be it by flame or pitchfork. Despite knowing this, you cannot fight back.
						These were your friends and neighbours, and so you must escape without harming anyone. Can you make it?
